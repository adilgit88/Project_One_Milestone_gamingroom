Course: CS 230 - Operating Systems and Software Principles
Project: Game Application Design Patterns 
Milestone: Project One

Contents:
1. GameService.java          - Contains the Singleton and Iterator pattern implementation.
2. ProgramDriver.java        - Entry point demonstrating use of GameService singleton.
3. SingletonTester.java      - Verifies singleton behavior.
4. CS230_Project_One_Assessment.pdf - Full project assessment including UML diagram and code.
5. CS230_GameApp_Project.zip - Compressed folder of source code.

Patterns Used:
- Singleton Pattern:
  Ensures that only one instance of GameService is created throughout the application.

- Iterator Pattern:
  Used in addGame() and getGame() methods to iterate through the list of Game objects and prevent duplicates.

Instructions:
1. Import the source files into your Java IDE - Eclipse recommended.
2. Run ProgramDriver.java to test the application functionality.
3. Review the CS230_Project_One_Assessment.pdf for detailed explanation and design pattern usage.
